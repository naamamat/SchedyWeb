Schedy is a shift placement system that utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to optimize schedules, enhancing workforce management efficiency. This project features a **React-based frontend**, a **Node.js and MongoDB backend**, and integrates **Python** for the scheduling algorithm.

## Features

- **Optimized Scheduling**: Uses an evolutionary algorithm to create efficient work schedules.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Node.js and MongoDB to handle data storage and business logic.
- **Algorithm**: Python-based algorithm for generating and optimizing schedules.
